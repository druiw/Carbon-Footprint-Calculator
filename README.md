# 🌱 Carbon Footprint Calculator

# 📚 SES 141 Design Project

A SwiftUI-based iOS app created for my **SES 141: Energy in Everyday Life** class at Arizona State University. This app helps users estimate their carbon footprint based on their energy usage and transportation habits. It aims to raise awareness about personal environmental impact and provides suggestions for reducing carbon emissions.

## 🔋 Purpose 

This project was developed as my "Design Project" for **SES 141: Energy in Everyday Life** course. The goal is to understand the environmental impact of energy consumption and transportation, and provide users with a tool to calculate and reduce their carbon footprint. The app is designed to help users make informed decisions about their daily energy use and travel habits, ultimately contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle.

## ✨ Features

- **Home Energy Calculator**: Users can input their monthly energy consumption (e.g., electricity, natural gas) to estimate their carbon footprint.
- **Transportation Calculator**: Users can calculate their carbon footprint based on the miles driven per month, vehicle fuel efficiency, and public transit usage.
- **Energy Saving Tips**: The app provides tips for reducing energy usage and lowering carbon emissions in both home energy consumption and transportation.

## 📱 Screens

- **Home Screen**: The main screen introduces the app with a "Begin" button that leads to the category selection screen.
- **Category View**: Allows users to choose between "Home Energy" and "Transportation" to calculate their carbon footprint in each category.
- **Home Energy View**: Users input their energy usage data and calculate the carbon footprint for their home energy consumption.
- **Transportation View**: Users input their transportation data (miles driven, fuel efficiency, and public transit rides) to calculate their transportation carbon footprint.
